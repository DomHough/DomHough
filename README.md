# 👋 Hi, I'm Dom

I'm a software engineer currently working in **Investment Banking**, with a strong interest in **Space**, **Machine Learning**, and **Physics-Based Simulations**. Outside of my professional work, I build systems that simulate real-world physics, autonomous agents, and social tools to connect people offline.

---

### 🛰️ Interests & Side Projects
My passion for space has led me to develop a custom script for landing rockets — inspired by SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Starship — using **kOS** in **Kerbal Space Program**. This evolved into a deeper pursuit: creating a **physically based ray tracing engine** as a precursor to a full-blown **physics engine**, helping simulate realistic rocket landings and dynamics.

### 🚀 What I’m Building

#### 🧠 BumpFuse – [Social Spontaneity App]
A **location-aware social media app** that promotes spontaneous real-world meetups with friends:
- Alerts users when they're near friends
- Suggests nearby places to hang out (bars, cafes, restaurants)
- Enables quick meetups with minimal friction
- Prioritizes privacy with proximity-based visibility

> Stack: `React Native`, `TypeScript`, `AWS`, `Expo`, `PostgreSQL`

#### 🚗 Deep Q-Learning Self-Driving Car
A self-driving car simulation built using **Deep Q-Learning**:
- Reinforcement learning agent trained to navigate 2D environments
- Learns optimal control policies via reward-based learning
- Great intro into deep RL + decision making under uncertainty

> Stack: `Python`, `NumPy`, `TensorFlow`

---

#### 🌄 Custom Ray Tracing Engine
A lightweight ray tracer for rendering 3D scenes with:
- Support for custom meshes and procedural textures
- Physically based lighting (no full physics simulation yet)
- Built from scratch with focus on modularity and rendering accuracy

> Stack: `Python`, `PyGame`
